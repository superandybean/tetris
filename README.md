# TETRIS

## Andrew Lam

Built with Java in 2019.

If you want to play Tetris audio, you may uncomment the `playClip("src/tetris.wav");` line found on line 53 of the `PanelMainMenu.java` file     

### How To Play

To play, run the `TetrisDriver.java` file. Press the Play button to play, High Score button to view high scores, and the Controls button to edit controls.     
Every five rows cleared, the level increases, decreasing the time delay between the each drop of the tetris block.      
Score increases by 100 for one cleared row, 200 for two cleared rows, 400 for three cleared rows, and 800 for four cleared rows.       
When dropping a piece, the score increases by (number of rows dropped * 2). When moving a piece down, the score increases by 1.
